# IncomePrediction

This is my first Python project after a couple of months of being off on this language due to schoolwork and other things. Imported a CSV dataset into Jupyter Notebook from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset). The idea of this project was to create a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to try to predict people's income. I used several libraries for this project (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, GridsearchCV, RandomForestClassifier, among others). This project took me a couple of months to finish since I was starting it during finals week at school. However, the results were pretty convincing. After training the model, I determined which features are more likely to work as predictors for people's income. Hope it's convincing for you as well!
